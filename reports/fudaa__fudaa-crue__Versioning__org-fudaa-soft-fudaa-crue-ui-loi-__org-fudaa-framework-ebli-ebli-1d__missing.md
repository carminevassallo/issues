## Description
Developers should follow principles (or best practices) in order to properly practice Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD).
We found that [org-fudaa-soft-fudaa-crue-ui-loi-](https://gitlab.com/fudaa/fudaa-crue/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) contains a violation of the following CI/CD principle:

> A build system should always specify the exact version of the external libraries that is using.
If not, developers canâ€™t reproduce the build. Failure to be absolutely specific also leads to an occasional long debugging session tracking down strange errors due to people or build systems using different versions of libraries.

## How to locate the violation

In org-fudaa-soft-fudaa-crue-ui-loi-, for the following dependency only the major release is specified in the version number.

* org-fudaa-framework-ebli-ebli-1d (line )

> **Suggested Fix:** Specify the exact version of dependency `org-fudaa-framework-ebli-ebli-1d`.
