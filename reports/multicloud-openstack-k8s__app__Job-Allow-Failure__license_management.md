# Title of the anti-pattern
Failures of job license_management do not fail the overall build.

## Description
Developers should follow principles (or best practices) in order to properly practice Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD).
We found that [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/multicloud-openstack-k8s/app/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) contains a violation of the following CI/CD principle:

> Every job that is scheduled for execution in the project's build should be set to fail the build in case of failures.
If not, developers might ignore the bug that causes the job's failure. Ignoring bugs could then translate to defects that occur in production.

## How to locate the violation
Failures of job `license_management`, that is defined at line  and executed in stage ``, are set to not fail the overall build.

```
license_management:
    ...
    allow_failure: true
    ...
```

> **Suggested Fix:** Modify ```allow_failure: true``` with ```allow_failure: false``` for job `license_management` in [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/multicloud-openstack-k8s/app/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)

## Information about this issue

This issue has been automatically generated by [CD-Linter](https://gitlab.com/Jancso/configuration-analytics), a tool that detects settings in the GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration that violate the principles of Continuous Delivery. Those principles, that are nowadays widely accepted, are discussed by Jez Humble and David Farley in their landmark [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-delivery-reliable/9780321670250/) on Continuous Delivery (CD). CD-Linter has been developed at the University of Zurich.
