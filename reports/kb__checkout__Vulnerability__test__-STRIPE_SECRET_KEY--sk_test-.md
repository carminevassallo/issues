# Title of the anti-pattern
Credentials are hardcoded in .gitlab-ci.yml

## Description
Developers should follow principles (or best practices) in order to properly practice Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD).
We found that [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/kb/checkout/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) contains a violation of the following CI/CD principle:

> Credentials should not be hardcoded in the configuration file. 
If so, they translate to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by external people. They could gain read/write access to project's resources (e.g., remote repository, deployment servers).

## How to locate the violation

Job `test`, that is defined at line  and executed in stage ``, contains the following credentials:

```
-STRIPE_SECRET_KEY--sk_test-
```

> **Suggested Fix:** Remove credentials from .gitlab-ci.yml and store them in secure remotely-accessible locations such as a database, directory, or registry.
