# Title of the anti-pattern
Job generate_release_note is manually triggered

## Description
Developers should follow principles (or best practices) in order to properly practice Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD).
We found that [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/hosweetim/timx-site/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) contains a violation of the following CI/CD principle:

> The build process has to be fully automated. 
When some stages are not automated, the process is not repeatable or reliable. Manual steps might introduce errors and cause delays in delivering code changes.

## How to locate the violation
Job `generate_release_note`, that is defined at line  and executed in stage ``, is set to be executed manually.

```
generate_release_note:
    ...
    when:manual
    ...
```

> **Suggested Fix:** Remove ```when:manual``` from the definition of job `generate_release_note`.
