# Title of the anti-pattern
Job snowflake_review_raw is not created when certain new commits are pushed.

## Description
Developers should follow principles (or best practices) in order to properly practice Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD).
We found that [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/meltano/analytics/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) contains a violation of the following CI/CD principle:

> Every committed change has to be built through the entire CI/CD pipeline (meaning that every defined job should be executed). 
If not, defects, that can only be reported during a certain job, might be discovered later in the development process (becoming harder to fix) or even discovered by users in production.

## How to locate the violation
Job `snowflake_review_raw`, that is defined at line , is set to not be created in stage `` if developers commit changes to the following files:

* `<FILES_LIST>`

While it is not necessarily worth triggering a full build for certain categories of changes (e.g., change to documentation or license files), the job `<JOB_NAME>` does not get executed also in presence of changes to production code that are included in the same git push.

This issue has been automatically generated by [CD-Linter](https://gitlab.com/Jancso/configuration-analytics), a tool that detects settings in the GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration that violate the principles of Continuous Delivery. Those principles, that are nowadays widely accepted, are discussed by Jez Humble and David Farley in their landmark [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-delivery-reliable/9780321670250/) on Continuous Delivery (CD). CD-Linter has been developed at the University of Zurich.
