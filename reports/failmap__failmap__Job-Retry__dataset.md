# Title of the anti-pattern
Job dataset is retried multiple times.

## Description
Developers should follow principles (or best practices) in order to properly practice Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD).
We found that [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/failmap/failmap/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) contains a violation of the following CI/CD principle:

> The build process has to be deterministic. Jobs that only after several attempts succeed might contain flaky tests. Flaky tests hinder development experience, slow down progress, hide real bugs and, in the end, cost money.
Thus, letting a job pass in a pseudorandom manner could potentially hide the presence of flaky tests that, instead, are required to be properly investigated and fixed.

## How to locate the violation
Job `dataset`, that is defined at line  and executed in stage ``, is set to be retried  times. 

```
dataset:
    ...
    retry: 
    ...
```

> **Suggested Fix:** Remove ```retry: ``` from the definition of job `dataset` or consider adding the option ```when``` to specify failures cases (e.g., ```runner_system_failure```) when the job can be retried without hiding flaky tests.


## Information about this issue

This issue has been automatically generated by [CD-Linter](https://gitlab.com/Jancso/configuration-analytics), a tool that detects settings in the GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration that violate the principles of Continuous Delivery. Those principles, that are nowadays widely accepted, are discussed by Jez Humble and David Farley in their landmark [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/continuous-delivery-reliable/9780321670250/) on Continuous Delivery (CD). CD-Linter has been developed at the University of Zurich.
